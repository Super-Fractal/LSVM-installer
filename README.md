# LSVM  
LayerSync Video Maker (LSVM) is an automated tool designed to tile a video on screen, export it, and then repeat the process. This allows for an exponential multiplication effect of the same video and audio.
Currently, LSVM primarily supports Windows with GPU

## Future Development & TODO List
We're actively working on improving LSVM! Here's what's on our roadmap:  

CPU Support: Enable processing on systems without a dedicated GPU.  

Configuration Screen: Implement a user interface for easier settings adjustment (e.g., resolution, iteration count, audio handling).    

Video Speed Control: Add an option to adjust the playback speed of the processed video.  

Google Colab Support: Make LSVM accessible and runnable on Google Colaboratory. (This allows it to run on most os)
